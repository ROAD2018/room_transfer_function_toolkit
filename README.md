__Repository description__ <br />
This repository contains a collection of matlab and python routines to accompany the paper
[Localization of Sound Sources in a Room with One Microphone](arXiv link:) 
by Helena Peic Tukujac, Herve Lissek and Pierre Vandergheynst
<br />
__Dependecies__: We have used some routines developed by other authors that are available online: <br />
mArrow function from https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25372-marrow3-m-easy-to-use-3d-arrow coded by Georg Stillfried. <br />
CoSaMP function from https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32402-cosamp-and-omp-for-sparse-recovery coded by Stephen Becker.
